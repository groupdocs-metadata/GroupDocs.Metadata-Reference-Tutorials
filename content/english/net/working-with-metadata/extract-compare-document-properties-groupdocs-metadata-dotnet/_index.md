# Extract & Compare Document Properties with GroupDocs.Metadata

## Introduction

Have you ever needed an efficient way to compare document properties across different files without manually checking each one? This tutorial will guide you through using **GroupDocs.Metadata** for .NET, a powerful tool that simplifies this task. You'll learn how to extract built-in document properties and find differences between two documents efficiently.

### What You'll Learn

- Setting up GroupDocs.Metadata in your .NET project
- Techniques for extracting built-in document properties using the library
- Methods to compare these properties across multiple files
- Practical applications of this feature in real-world scenarios

Ready to dive into an efficient way to handle document metadata? Let’s get started with the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have:

- **.NET Core SDK** installed (version 3.1 or later recommended)
- A basic understanding of C# and .NET programming
- Visual Studio or any compatible IDE

Additionally, you'll need to install GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET

To use GroupDocs.Metadata in your project, follow these installation steps:

### Installation Instructions

**.NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Metadata
```

**Package Manager:**

```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Metadata
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:** 
Search for "GroupDocs.Metadata" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps

- **Free Trial**: Start by downloading a trial from the [GroupDocs website](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license).
- **Temporary License**: Apply for a temporary license to explore full features.
- **Purchase License**: For commercial use, purchase a license directly from GroupDocs.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup

After installation, initialize GroupDocs.Metadata in your project:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Metadata;

// Initialize metadata for a document
Metadata metadata = new Metadata("your-document-path.docx");
```

## Implementation Guide

Now that you've set up the library, let’s implement the feature to extract and compare document properties.

### Extracting Built-In Document Properties

This functionality allows you to retrieve specific metadata embedded in documents like author name, creation date, etc. Here's how:

#### Step 1: Define the Predicate Function

A predicate function filters out properties that are not built-in:

```csharp
Func<MetadataProperty, bool> isBuiltIn = p => p.Tags.Contains(Tags.Document.BuiltIn);
```

#### Step 2: Load Documents and Extract Properties

Load two documents and use the predicate to filter their properties:

```csharp
using (Metadata metadata1 = new Metadata(documentPath1))
using (Metadata metadata2 = new Metadata(documentPath2))
{
    var properties1 = metadata1.FindProperties(isBuiltIn);
    var properties2 = metadata2.FindProperties(isBuiltIn);
}
```

#### Step 3: Compare Properties

Use LINQ to find differences between the two sets of properties:

```csharp
var difference = properties1.Except(properties2, new MetadataPropertyEqualityComparer());

foreach (var property in difference)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{property.Name} = {property.Value}");
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Common Issue**: If you encounter a `FileNotFoundException`, ensure your file paths are correct.
- **Performance Tip**: For large documents, consider optimizing memory usage by processing properties in batches.

## Practical Applications

Understanding document metadata is crucial in various scenarios:

1. **Version Control**: Compare document versions for auditing purposes.
2. **Data Migration**: Ensure consistency when migrating files between systems.
3. **Compliance Checks**: Verify property compliance with organizational standards.
4. **Digital Signatures**: Validate authorship and creation dates.

Integrating GroupDocs.Metadata can streamline these processes, enhancing efficiency across workflows.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large datasets or numerous documents, consider the following:

- Optimize performance by processing metadata in chunks if possible.
- Use efficient data structures to store and compare properties.
- Follow .NET best practices for memory management, such as disposing of objects promptly.

These strategies will help maintain optimal resource usage while using GroupDocs.Metadata.

## Conclusion

By now, you should be equipped to extract and compare document properties efficiently with GroupDocs.Metadata in .NET. This feature simplifies metadata handling across different documents, saving time and reducing errors.
