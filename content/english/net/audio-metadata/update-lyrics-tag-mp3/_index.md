# Update Lyrics Tag in MP3 Files using .NET

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to use the GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET library to update the lyrics tag in MP3 files programmatically. This process involves accessing and modifying the metadata of MP3 files, specifically targeting the lyrics information.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Basic knowledge of C# programming.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET library installed (refer to [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/metadata/net/)).
- An MP3 file for testing purposes.

## Import Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces into your C# project:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Formats.Audio;
using System;
using GroupDocs.Metadata;
```
## Step 1: Load the MP3 File
First, load the MP3 file into a `Metadata` object using GroupDocs.Metadata:
```csharp
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata("path_to_your_mp3_file.mp3"))
{
    var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<MP3RootPackage>();
    // Access the Lyrics3V2 tag
    if (root.Lyrics3V2 == null)
    {
        root.Lyrics3V2 = new LyricsTag();
    }
```
## Step 2: Update Lyrics Information
Next, update the lyrics information along with other relevant details such as artist, album, and track:
```csharp
    root.Lyrics3V2.Lyrics = "[00:01]Test lyrics";
    root.Lyrics3V2.Artist = "test artist";
    root.Lyrics3V2.Album = "test album";
    root.Lyrics3V2.Track = "test track";
```
## Step 3: Add Custom Fields (Optional)
Optionally, you can add custom fields to the tag:
```csharp
    root.Lyrics3V2.Set(new LyricsField("ABC", "custom value"));
```
## Step 4: Save the Changes
Finally, save the modified metadata back to the MP3 file:
```csharp
    metadata.Save("path_to_your_output_file.mp3");
}
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to update the lyrics tag in MP3 files using GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET. By following the outlined steps, you can efficiently manage and modify metadata within MP3 files programmatically.
