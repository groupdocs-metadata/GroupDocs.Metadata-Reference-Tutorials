# How to Update Built-In Properties in Project Management Documents Using GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET

## Introduction
Managing project documents effectively often requires updating metadata such as the author, creation date, and keywords. Manually editing these properties can be time-consuming and error-prone. This tutorial demonstrates how to use **GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET**, a powerful library that automates updating built-in properties in MPP files. By automating this process, you ensure your documents have accurate metadata with minimal effort.

### What You'll Learn:
- How to update built-in document properties such as Author, CreationDate, Company, Comments, and Keywords.
- Implementing GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET in a project.
- Practical applications of updating metadata in project management contexts.

## Prerequisites
Before implementing this solution, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET**: Ensure you have the latest version installed. 
- **Project Management Documents**: Sample MPP files to work with.
  
### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment supporting .NET (preferably .NET Core or .NET Framework 4.6+).
- Visual Studio IDE for code editing and debugging.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with .NET project setup and NuGet package management.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET
To integrate GroupDocs.Metadata into your project, you need to install the library via one of these methods:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Metadata
```

**Package Manager**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Metadata
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI**
- Open NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.
- Search for "GroupDocs.Metadata" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps
You can start with a free trial by downloading a temporary license from [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/). For long-term use, consider purchasing a license. Follow these steps:
1. **Download** the library via NuGet or GroupDocs website.
2. **Apply** the license using the provided instructions in their documentation.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, initialize your project to work with metadata:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Metadata;
using GroupDocs.Metadata.Formats.Document;

// Initialize metadata object for MPP file
Metadata metadata = new Metadata("path/to/your/file.mpp");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Overview of the Feature
This feature focuses on updating built-in properties in Project Management documents using C#. We'll update properties like Author, CreationDate, Company, Comments, and Keywords.

#### Step 1: Load the Project Management Document

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Metadata;
using GroupDocs.Metadata.Formats.Document;

public class UpdateBuiltInProperties
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        string inputPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\input.mpp";
        using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata(inputPath))
```

- **Purpose**: Load the MPP document to access and modify its properties.
- **Why**: Access is necessary before any modification can occur.

#### Step 2: Retrieve Document Properties

```csharp
            // Retrieve the root package of the Project Management file format
            var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<ProjectManagementRootPackage>();
```

- **Purpose**: Get a reference to the root package containing document properties.
- **Why**: Allows direct manipulation of built-in properties.

#### Step 3: Update Built-In Properties
Update each property as needed:

```csharp
            // Set Author
            root.DocumentProperties.Author = "test author";

            // Set CreationDate to current date and time
            root.DocumentProperties.CreationDate = DateTime.Now;

            // Set Company
            root.DocumentProperties.Company = "GroupDocs";

            // Add Comments
            root.DocumentProperties.Comments = "test comment";

            // Define Keywords for categorization
            root.DocumentProperties.Keywords = "metadata, built-in, update";
```

- **Parameters Explained**:
  - `Author`: Sets the document's author.
  - `CreationDate`: Updates to the current date and time.
  - `Company`: Associates the document with a company name.
  - `Comments`: Adds user-defined comments.
  - `Keywords`: Helps in metadata categorization.

#### Step 4: Save the Updated Document

```csharp
            // Save the changes to a new file
            string outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\output.mpp";
            metadata.Save(outputPath);
        }
    }
}
```

- **Purpose**: Persist changes by saving the updated document.
- **Why**: Ensures all updates are stored in a new version of the MPP file.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure you have write permissions to the directories involved.
- Check that your MPP files aren't locked or open elsewhere, which may prevent modifications.

## Practical Applications
Updating built-in properties can be useful in various scenarios:
1. **Project Tracking**: Automatically update creation dates and authors as projects progress.
2. **Compliance Audits**: Ensure all documents have accurate metadata for audits.
3. **Search Optimization**: Use keywords to improve document retrieval efficiency in digital asset management systems.
4. **Company Branding**: Maintain consistent company information across all project files.

## Performance Considerations
When working with GroupDocs.Metadata, consider these best practices:
- Optimize resource usage by processing only necessary documents.
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of metadata objects promptly after use.
- For large-scale operations, batch process documents to minimize system load.

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you've learned how to automate updating built-in properties in Project Management documents using **GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET**. This automation not only saves time but also ensures consistency and accuracy in your document metadata.

## FAQ Section
1. **What are built-in properties?**
   - Built-in properties are predefined metadata fields like Author and CreationDate that describe a document's attributes.
2. **Can I update multiple documents at once?**
   - Yes, you can iterate over multiple files in a directory to apply updates in batch mode.
3. **Does GroupDocs.Metadata support other file formats?**
   - Absolutely! It supports various formats including images, PDFs, and more alongside MPP files.
