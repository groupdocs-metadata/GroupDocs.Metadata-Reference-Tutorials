## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET to extract document statistics from diagrams. GroupDocs.Metadata is a powerful library that allows developers to work with metadata associated with various file formats. By following this step-by-step guide, you'll learn how to read document statistics from diagrams using C#.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following set up:
- Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio on your machine.
- GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET. You can get it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/metadata/net/).
- Input File: Have a diagram file ready for testing.

## Import Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# project.
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Metadata;
using GroupDocs.Metadata.Formats.Document;
```

Follow these steps to extract document statistics from a diagram file:
## Step 1: Load the Metadata
First, initialize the `Metadata` object by loading your input diagram file.
```csharp
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata("YourInputFile"))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```
Replace `"YourInputFile"` with the path to your diagram file.
## Step 2: Access Diagram Metadata
Next, retrieve the root package of the diagram file, specifically targeting the `DiagramRootPackage`.
```csharp
var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<DiagramRootPackage>();
```
This will give you access to the metadata of the diagram.
## Step 3: Read Document Statistics
Now, use the `DiagramRootPackage` object to access document statistics like the number of pages.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(root.DocumentStatistics.PageCount);
```
Here, we print out the total number of pages in the diagram.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to extract document statistics from diagrams using GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET. By leveraging this library, developers can efficiently work with metadata of various file formats within their .NET applications.
