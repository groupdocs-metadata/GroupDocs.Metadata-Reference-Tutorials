## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET to read custom properties from diagrams efficiently. GroupDocs.Metadata is a powerful API that allows developers to work with metadata in various document formats, including diagrams. Custom properties can contain valuable information embedded within diagrams, and accessing them programmatically can streamline document processing tasks. By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to retrieve custom properties from diagram files using GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
- Development Environment: Make sure you have Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment installed.
- GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET: Download and install the GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/metadata/net/).
- Diagram Files: Have sample diagram files (e.g., .vsdx) ready to test the code snippets.

## Import Namespaces
First, include the necessary namespaces in your C# code:
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Metadata;
using GroupDocs.Metadata.Formats.Document;
using GroupDocs.Tagging;
```
## Step 1: Load Diagram File
Begin by loading the diagram file using GroupDocs.Metadata:
```csharp
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata("YourInputFile.vsdx"))
{
    // Code for processing metadata will go here
}
```
Replace `"YourInputFile.vsdx"` with the path to your diagram file.
## Step 2: Retrieve Custom Properties
Within the `using` block, retrieve custom properties from the diagram:
```csharp
var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<DiagramRootPackage>();
var customProperties = root.DocumentProperties.FindProperties(p => !p.Tags.Contains(Tags.Document.BuiltIn));
```
Here, `root` represents the root package of the diagram, and `customProperties` is a collection of custom document properties excluding built-in properties.
## Step 3: Iterate and Display Properties
Next, iterate through the `customProperties` collection and display each property:
```csharp
foreach (var property in customProperties)
{
    Console.WriteLine("{0} = {1}", property.Name, property.Value);
}
```
This loop will print out the name and value of each custom property found in the diagram.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to use GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET to read custom properties from diagram files efficiently. By following the steps outlined above, you can integrate metadata extraction capabilities into your .NET applications seamlessly.
