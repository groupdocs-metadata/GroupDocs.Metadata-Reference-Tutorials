### License Acquisition

To explore all features, you can acquire a free trial or temporary license from [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license). This allows full access without limitations during your evaluation period. For long-term use, consider purchasing a license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

After installation, import the necessary namespaces in your C# file:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Metadata.Formats.Document;
using GroupDocs.Metadata;
```

Initialize the `Metadata` class to start working with your Word documents:

```csharp
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata("input.docx"))
{
    var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<WordProcessingRootPackage>();
    // Further operations...
}
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll explore how to extract and display various elements from a Word document using GroupDocs.Metadata.

### Extracting and Displaying Comments

#### Overview
This feature helps you retrieve comments embedded within your Word documents, providing insights into the annotations made by collaborators. This is particularly useful for reviewing changes or understanding feedback quickly.

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Load Document**

Start by loading your document using the `Metadata` class:

```csharp
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata("input.docx"))
{
    var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<WordProcessingRootPackage>();
    
    // Check for comments and process them
}
```

**Step 2: Access Comments**

Access the inspection package to check if comments are available, then iterate over each comment:

```csharp
if (root.InspectionPackage.Comments != null)
{
    foreach (var comment in root.InspectionPackage.Comments)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Author: {comment.Author}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Created Date: {comment.CreatedDate}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Comment Text: {comment.Text}\n");
    }
}
```

- **Parameters Explained**:
  - `Author`: Displays the name of the person who added the comment.
  - `CreatedDate`: Shows when the comment was created.
  - `Text`: Outputs the actual content of the comment.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your document path is correct and accessible.
- Handle exceptions for file access errors using try-catch blocks to make your application robust.

## Practical Applications

1. **Collaborative Document Reviews**: Quickly review comments in shared documents during team projects.
2. **Auditing Changes**: Track all annotations made by different stakeholders.
3. **Document Management Systems**: Integrate this feature into larger systems for automated document inspections.
4. **Legal and Compliance Checks**: Ensure all feedback is addressed before finalizing official documentation.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance, consider the following:

- Process documents in batches to manage memory usage effectively.
