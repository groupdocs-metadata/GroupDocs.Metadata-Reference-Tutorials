## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to leverage GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET to efficiently read file format properties from spreadsheets. GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET is a powerful API that allows developers to extract, edit, and manage metadata associated with various file formats within their .NET applications. We will specifically focus on retrieving essential information about spreadsheet files using this library.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio on your development machine.
2. GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/metadata/net/).
3. Valid License: Obtain a valid license from [GroupDocs](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) or use a [temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for testing purposes.

## Import Namespaces
First, import the necessary namespaces in your .NET project to access the GroupDocs.Metadata functionality:
```csharp
using System;
using Formats.Document;
```
## Step 1: Load the Spreadsheet File
Begin by initializing a `Metadata` object with the path to your spreadsheet file:
```csharp
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata("YourInputFile.xlsx"))
{
    // Access metadata properties here...
}
```
Replace `"YourInputFile.xlsx"` with the path to your actual spreadsheet file.
## Step 2: Extract Root Package Information
Retrieve the root package associated with the spreadsheet file format:
```csharp
var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<SpreadsheetRootPackage>();
```
## Step 3: Access File Format Properties
Now, you can access various properties related to the file format:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(root.FileType.FileFormat);
Console.WriteLine(root.FileType.SpreadsheetFormat);
Console.WriteLine(root.FileType.MimeType);
Console.WriteLine(root.FileType.Extension);
```
Here's a breakdown of what each property represents:
- `FileFormat`: Identifies the specific format of the file.
- `SpreadsheetFormat`: Specifies the exact type of spreadsheet format.
- `MimeType`: Provides the MIME type associated with the spreadsheet.
- `Extension`: Indicates the file extension typically associated with this format.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored how to use GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET to retrieve essential file format properties from spreadsheet documents. This library offers robust capabilities for managing metadata across various file types, empowering developers to integrate metadata handling seamlessly into their .NET applications.
