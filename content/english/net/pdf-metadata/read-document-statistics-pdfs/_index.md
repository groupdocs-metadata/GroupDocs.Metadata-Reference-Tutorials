## Introduction
In the world of software development, managing document metadata efficiently is crucial for many applications. GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET provides powerful tools to read and manipulate metadata within various document formats. This tutorial focuses on harnessing this capability specifically for PDF files using .NET. By the end of this guide, you'll understand how to extract document statistics such as character count, page count, and word count from PDFs using GroupDocs.Metadata.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:
- Development Environment: Ensure you have Visual Studio or another .NET development environment installed.
- GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET: Download and install the GroupDocs.Metadata library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/metadata/net/).
- Basic C# Knowledge: Familiarity with C# programming language and .NET framework.

## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# project to use GroupDocs.Metadata functionalities:
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Metadata;
using GroupDocs.Metadata.Formats.Document;
```

Let's break down the example into multiple steps to understand how to read document statistics from PDF files using GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET.
## Step 1: Load Metadata from PDF File
The first step is to load the metadata from the PDF file using the `Metadata` class provided by GroupDocs.Metadata:
```csharp
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata("YourInputFile.pdf"))
{
    // Code goes here
}
```
## Step 2: Extract PDF Root Package
Next, extract the root package of the PDF document to access its statistics:
```csharp
var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<PdfRootPackage>();
```
## Step 3: Access Document Statistics
Now, you can access various document statistics such as character count, page count, and word count from the PDF:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Character Count: " + root.DocumentStatistics.CharacterCount);
Console.WriteLine("Page Count: " + root.DocumentStatistics.PageCount);
Console.WriteLine("Word Count: " + root.DocumentStatistics.WordCount);
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored how to leverage GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET to read document statistics from PDF files. By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate metadata management into your .NET applications, empowering you to extract valuable insights from PDF documents.
