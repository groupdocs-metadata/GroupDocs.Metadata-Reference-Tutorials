# How to Update Email Metadata Using GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET

## Introduction
Email metadata management is essential in software development to ensure data integrity and accuracy. With **GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET**, developers can automate updates to sender information, delivery times, and custom headers efficiently.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:
- How to update sender information
- Setting custom delivery times
- Modifying specific email headers

By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped with skills to enhance your .NET applications. Let's begin with the prerequisites.

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
1. **Required Libraries and Versions**: GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET (version 23.x or later)
2. **Environment Setup**: 
   - A development environment with .NET Core SDK installed
   - Visual Studio or any preferred IDE supporting C#
3. **Knowledge Prerequisites**: 
   - Basic understanding of .NET programming concepts
   - Familiarity with file operations in C#

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET
To start, install the GroupDocs.Metadata library using one of these methods:

### Installation Instructions
**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Metadata
```

**Using Package Manager:**
```powershell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Metadata
```

**Using NuGet Package Manager UI:**
Search for "GroupDocs.Metadata" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
To use GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET, you can:
- Download a [free trial](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license) to explore its features.
- Obtain a temporary license if needed beyond the trial period.
- Purchase a full license from their [official website](https://purchase.groupdocs.com).

After installation, initialize your project by adding necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using Formats.Email;
using GroupDocs.Metadata.Common;
```

## Implementation Guide
We'll break down the implementation into three main features: updating sender information, setting delivery time, and modifying email headers. Each section will provide a detailed guide on how to accomplish these tasks.

### Update Email Sender Information
Updating an email's sender details is often necessary for maintaining accurate correspondence records. Let’s see how you can achieve this using GroupDocs.Metadata.

#### Overview
This feature updates the sender's email address and name within an MSG file, ensuring your emails reflect correct source information.

##### Step 1: Initialize Metadata Object
First, initialize the `Metadata` object with the path to your input MSG file:
```csharp
var inputMsgPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.msg";
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata(inputMsgPath))
{
    // Code continues...
}
```

##### Step 2: Access Email Properties
Access the root package and update sender information:
```csharp
var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<MsgRootPackage>();
root.EmailPackage.SenderEmailAddress = "sender@sender.com";
root.EmailPackage.SenderName = "Sender Name";
```
**Explanation**: This step retrieves the email-specific properties using `GetRootPackage`. The `SenderEmailAddress` and `SenderName` are updated to reflect new values.

##### Step 3: Save Changes
Finally, save your changes to a new MSG file:
```csharp
var outputMsgPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/output.msg";
metadata.Save(outputMsgPath);
```

### Update Email Delivery Time
Setting the correct delivery time can be essential for tracking and archiving purposes. Here's how you can update it programmatically.

#### Overview
This feature allows setting a custom delivery timestamp for an email message, aiding in accurate record-keeping.

##### Step 1: Initialize Metadata Object
Similar to updating sender information, start by initializing the `Metadata` object:
```csharp
var inputMsgPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.msg";
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata(inputMsgPath))
{
    // Code continues...
}
```

##### Step 2: Set Delivery Time
Access and modify the delivery time:
```csharp
var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<MsgRootPackage>();
root.EmailPackage.DeliveryTime = DateTime.Now;
```
**Explanation**: This code sets the email's delivery timestamp to the current date and time, which can be customized as needed.

##### Step 3: Save Changes
Save your modifications:
```csharp
var outputMsgPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/output.msg";
metadata.Save(outputMsgPath);
```

### Update Email Headers
Custom headers provide flexibility for adding metadata that isn’t covered by standard fields. Here's how to update them using GroupDocs.Metadata.

#### Overview
This feature lets you add or modify custom headers within an email message, enhancing the metadata richness of your emails.

##### Step 1: Initialize Metadata Object
Start with initializing the `Metadata` object:
```csharp
var inputMsgPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.msg";
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata(inputMsgPath))
{
    // Code continues...
}
```

##### Step 2: Modify Headers
Add or update headers as required:
```csharp
var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<MsgRootPackage>();
root.EmailPackage.Headers.Set("X-Custom-Header", "CustomValue");
```
**Explanation**: This snippet demonstrates how to set a custom header named `X-Custom-Header` with the value `CustomValue`.

##### Step 3: Save Changes
Ensure your changes are saved:
```csharp
var outputMsgPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/output.msg";
metadata.Save(outputMsgPath);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Issues**: Ensure the paths to input and output files are correct.
- **Permission Errors**: Verify file permissions if you encounter access issues.
- **Version Compatibility**: Use a compatible version of GroupDocs.Metadata to avoid API changes.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where these features can be applied:
1. **Automated Email Corrections**: Bulk update sender details for compliance in corporate settings.
2. **Audit Trails**: Set delivery timestamps for accurate audit trails and reporting.
3. **Custom Metadata Integration**: Add custom headers to integrate with third-party systems like CRM tools.

## Performance Considerations
When working with GroupDocs.Metadata, consider these tips to optimize performance:
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of `Metadata` objects properly to free resources.
- **Batch Processing**: Process files in batches to manage resource usage effectively.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilize asynchronous methods for non-blocking operations where possible.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to update email metadata using GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET. These capabilities allow you to maintain precise and accurate email records, enhancing both operational efficiency and data integrity in your applications.

To further explore the potential of GroupDocs.Metadata, consider experimenting with other features such as reading and exporting metadata or integrating it into larger systems.
