## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will delve into leveraging GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET to efficiently extract built-in properties from Project Management documents. This library provides robust functionality for managing metadata in various file formats, including Microsoft Project, allowing developers to access key document details programmatically. We will guide you through the process step-by-step, breaking down each example to ensure clarity and ease of implementation.
## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
- GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET Library: Download and install the library from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/metadata/net/).
- Development Environment: Have a compatible IDE (such as Visual Studio) installed on your machine.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language and .NET framework.

## Import Namespaces
Begin by including the necessary namespaces in your C# project:
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Metadata;
using GroupDocs.Metadata.Formats.Document;
```
## Step 1: Instantiate Metadata Object
First, instantiate the `Metadata` object by specifying the input file path:
```csharp
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata("YourInputFile"))
{
    // Code goes here
}
```
Replace `"YourInputFile"` with the path to your Project Management document.
## Step 2: Access Project Management Metadata
Next, retrieve the root package specific to Project Management documents:
```csharp
var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<ProjectManagementRootPackage>();
```
This `root` object will allow access to document properties.
## Step 3: Retrieve Document Properties
Now, you can extract various built-in properties from the Project Management document:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(root.DocumentProperties.Author);
Console.WriteLine(root.DocumentProperties.CreationDate);
Console.WriteLine(root.DocumentProperties.Company);
Console.WriteLine(root.DocumentProperties.Category);
Console.WriteLine(root.DocumentProperties.Keywords);
Console.WriteLine(root.DocumentProperties.Revision);
Console.WriteLine(root.DocumentProperties.Subject);
```
Each `WriteLine` statement retrieves a specific property such as Author, Creation Date, Company, Category, Keywords, Revision, and Subject.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET simplifies the process of extracting metadata from Project Management documents. By following this tutorial, you've learned how to use the library to access crucial document details programmatically.
