## Introduction
In the realm of .NET development, managing document metadata efficiently is crucial for applications dealing with presentations, spreadsheets, and other file formats. GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET provides a robust solution for accessing, editing, and extracting metadata from various file types. This tutorial will guide you through reading document statistics specifically from presentations using GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Visual Studio installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of C# programming
- GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/metadata/net/)
- An input presentation file (e.g., PPTX format) for testing

## Import Namespaces
Begin by importing the necessary namespaces into your C# project:
```csharp
using System;
using Formats.Document;
```
## Step 1: Initialize Metadata Object
To read document statistics from a presentation file, initialize a `Metadata` object with the path to your input file:
```csharp
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata("YourInputFile.pptx"))
{
    // Code to access metadata will go here
}
```
## Step 2: Retrieve Presentation Root Package
Next, obtain the root package specific to presentations (`PresentationRootPackage`) from the `Metadata` object:
```csharp
var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<PresentationRootPackage>();
```
## Step 3: Access Document Statistics
Once you have the root package, you can easily access the document statistics such as character count, page count, and word count:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Character Count: " + root.DocumentStatistics.CharacterCount);
Console.WriteLine("Page Count: " + root.DocumentStatistics.PageCount);
Console.WriteLine("Word Count: " + root.DocumentStatistics.WordCount);
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you learned how to utilize GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET to read document statistics from presentations in a straightforward manner. Leveraging this library allows you to efficiently manage metadata within your .NET applications.
