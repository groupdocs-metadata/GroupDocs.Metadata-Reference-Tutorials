## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to update custom properties in spreadsheets using the GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET library. Custom properties can enhance the metadata of your spreadsheet files, providing additional context or information that is not covered by standard properties.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/metadata/net/).
- Visual Studio: Use this IDE for .NET development.
- Spreadsheet File: Have a spreadsheet file (e.g., Excel) to work with.

## Import Namespaces
To start, include the necessary namespaces in your C# code:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Metadata.Formats.Document;
using System;
using GroupDocs.Metadata;
```

Let's break down the process of updating custom properties into manageable steps:
## Step 1: Load the Spreadsheet File
Initialize the `Metadata` object by loading your spreadsheet file:
```csharp
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata("YourInputFile.xlsx"))
{
    var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<SpreadsheetRootPackage>();
```
## Step 2: Set Custom Properties
Set custom properties using the `DocumentProperties` object:
```csharp
root.DocumentProperties.Set("customProperty1", "some value");
root.DocumentProperties.Set("customProperty2", 7);
```
You can set properties of different data types like strings, integers, or other compatible types.
## Step 3: Set Content Type Property
For certain file types, you can also set content type properties:
```csharp
root.DocumentProperties.ContentTypeProperties.Set("customContentTypeProperty", "custom value");
```
This allows you to define specific properties related to the content type of the document.
## Step 4: Save the Modified Metadata
After updating the properties, save the changes back to the spreadsheet file:
```csharp
metadata.Save("YourInputFile.xlsx");
```

## Conclusion
Updating custom properties in spreadsheets using GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET is a straightforward process. By following the steps outlined above, you can efficiently modify metadata to suit your specific needs.
