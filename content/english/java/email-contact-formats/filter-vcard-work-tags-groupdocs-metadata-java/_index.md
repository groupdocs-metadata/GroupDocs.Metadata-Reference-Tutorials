      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/metadata/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-metadata</artifactId>
      <version>24.12</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
### Direct Download

### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a license for long-term use.

With GroupDocs.Metadata set up, you're ready to implement the filtering functionality. Let's proceed with the implementation guide.

## Implementation Guide

### Filtering vCard Work Tags and Preferred Items
This feature allows you to efficiently filter work-related tags and preferred items from a vCard file.

#### Step 1: Load the vCard File
Load your vCard file using GroupDocs.Metadata. Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/your_vcard_file.vcf"` with the path to your vCard file:
```java
try (Metadata metadata = new Metadata("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/your_vcard_file.vcf")) {
    // Code continues...
}
```
#### Step 2: Access the Root Package
Access the root package of the vCard to interact with its contents:
```java
VCardRootPackage root = metadata.getRootPackageGeneric();
```
#### Step 3: Iterate Through Each Card
Loop through each card in the vCard package to apply filters:
```java
for (VCardCard vCard : root.getVCardPackage().getCards()) {
    // Further processing...
}
```
#### Step 4: Apply Filters
Use `filterWorkTags()` and `filterPreferred()` methods to filter work-related tags and preferred contact information:
```java
VCardCard filtered = vCard.filterWorkTags().filterPreferred();
```
#### Step 5: Print Filtered Data
Print the filtered telephone numbers and emails for verification:
```java
printArray(filtered.getCommunicationRecordset().getTelephones());
printArray(filtered.getCommunicationRecordset().getEmails());

private static void printArray(String[] values) {
    if (values != null) {
        for (String value : values) {
            System.out.println(value);
        }
    }
}
```
### Managing Metadata for Specific Formats
This section covers managing metadata specifically for business card formats using GroupDocs.Metadata.

#### Step 1: Load the vCard File
As before, load your vCard file to begin:
```java
try (Metadata metadata = new Metadata("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/your_vcard_file.vcf")) {
    // Code continues...
}
```
#### Additional Operations
You can add more operations on the root package to demonstrate specific functionalities.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases for filtering vCard tags:
1. **Business Networking**: Quickly extract work-related contact information from large datasets.
2. **CRM Integration**: Enhance customer relationship management systems by integrating filtered contact data.
3. **Automated Workflows**: Streamline automated processes that require specific contact details.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Metadata:
- Manage memory usage efficiently, especially with large vCard files.
- Use appropriate Java memory management practices to prevent leaks.
- Profile your application to identify and address bottlenecks.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learned how to filter work-related tags and preferred items from vCards using GroupDocs.Metadata for Java. By following these steps, you can enhance your contact management processes and integrate them into broader systems effectively.

Next, consider exploring other features of GroupDocs.Metadata or integrating it with additional tools in your tech stack.
