# Read ID3V1 Tag from MP3 Files in .NET

## Introduction
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to extract ID3V1 tags from MP3 files using GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET. GroupDocs.Metadata is a powerful library that allows you to work with metadata in various file formats, including MP3 audio files. We'll guide you through the process step by step.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Basic knowledge of C# programming
- Visual Studio installed on your system
- GroupDocs.Metadata library for .NET (You can download it [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/metadata/net/))
- An MP3 file with ID3V1 tags for testing

## Import Namespaces
First, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your C# project to use GroupDocs.Metadata functionalities:
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Metadata;
using GroupDocs.Formats.Audio;
```
## Step 1: Load the Metadata of the MP3 File
Begin by creating a `Metadata` object and loading the metadata of your MP3 file:
```csharp
using (Metadata metadata = new Metadata("YourInputFile.mp3"))
{
    // Your code will go here
}
```
Replace `"YourInputFile.mp3"` with the path to your MP3 file.
## Step 2: Access the ID3V1 Tag Information
Next, retrieve the root package and access the ID3V1 tag from the MP3 file's metadata:
```csharp
var root = metadata.GetRootPackage<MP3RootPackage>();
if (root.ID3V1 != null)
{
    // Access ID3V1 tag properties
    Console.WriteLine("Album: " + root.ID3V1.Album);
    Console.WriteLine("Artist: " + root.ID3V1.Artist);
    Console.WriteLine("Title: " + root.ID3V1.Title);
    Console.WriteLine("Version: " + root.ID3V1.Version);
    Console.WriteLine("Comment: " + root.ID3V1.Comment);
    
    // You can access more properties as needed
}
```
## Step 3: Use the Extracted ID3V1 Tag Information
Once you have accessed the ID3V1 tag properties, you can use this information as per your requirements. For example, you can display these details in a console application, store them in a database, or use them for further processing.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you learned how to read ID3V1 tag information from MP3 files using GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET. By following these simple steps, you can efficiently work with metadata associated with MP3 audio files in your .NET applications.
